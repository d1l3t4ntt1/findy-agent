# Documentation

Most of the architecture-level documentation is currently in the main readme
file. The rest of the documentation is code
files where it is accessible with Go doc. This folder includes most of the
pictures and drawings.

## UML Diagrams - PlantUML

These UML diagrams illustrate the high-level architecture and functionality of
the findy-agent. The use case diagrams show how what kind of functionality is
available. Architecture diagrams show the component layout of the system. And
protocols are drawn with UML sequences and state diagrams.
